            champion food security and combat hunger or in other words food insecurity that has ravaged Kenya and her
            neighbours for a very many decades. <br>
            <br>Landords and investors are challenged to join pact in this move, wherein land owners are incouraged to
            rent out their land to the investors on a contract.
            Agricultural from various projects/schemes are also given a room to be showcased throughtout this platform
            through which producers(investors)
            will a advertise their produce to the traders or even consumers, this culture will set a win win situation
            across all key stakeholdres in this particular.
